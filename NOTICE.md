**Code** in this repository is MIT licensed (see `LICENSE`).

**Data derived from PID2Graph** (Zenodo record 14803338, CC BY-SA 4.0, including the OPEN100 design by the Energy
Impact Center) is shared under **CC BY-SA 4.0**, as that license requires. This covers:
- `data/sheet_registers/`;
- the extracted twin packages under `out/twin/` (plant models, review queues, SVGs, Ignition and PI AF files built
  from the drawings);
- the Perspective screens in `out/ignition/gateway/PIDTwin.zip` that embed those SVGs.

The source drawings and answer keys themselves are not redistributed. `scripts/fetch_pid2graph.py` downloads them.

**Tennessee Eastman** simulation code and data are from the Braatz group (University of Illinois, NCSA-style
license). They are downloaded by `scripts/verify_te_source.py` and `scripts/fetch_te_data.py`, not redistributed.
The process is from Downs & Vogel (1993). The flowsheet in this repo is redrawn from the model, not copied from the
paper.
